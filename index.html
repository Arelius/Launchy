        <h3>Welcome to the new Launchy Home.</h3>

<p>Using its creator words:</p>

<pre><code>Launchy is: a free cross-platform utility designed to help you forget 
about your start menu, the icons on your desktop, 
and even your file manager.

Launchy indexes the programs in your start menu 
and can launch your documents, project files, 
folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes!

Josh Karlin
</code></pre>

<p>The original author no longer maintains Launchy so at this point the project is in the hand of the Open Source community.</p>

<p>From this page you can download the last version of Launchy along its new features and bugfixes!</p>

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>Launchy comes with a good-to-look-at, customizable, skinnable user interface. Take a look:</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
